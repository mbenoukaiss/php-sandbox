# PHP Sandbox
Provides a local tool that allows testing PHP features without any 
restrictions that online tools such as https://sandbox.onlinephpfunctions.com/ 
have. 

# Disclaimer
The script is not meant to be ran on a server. This is **not a safe 
sandbox**, you should not run code that you do not trust, the goal 
of this tool is to run PHP snippets to test the features and 
behaviour of PHP.
