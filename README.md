# PHP Sandbox
Provides a local tool that allows testing PHP features without any 
restrictions that online tools such as https://sandbox.onlinephpfunctions.com/ 
have. 

This is **not a safe sandbox**, you should not run code that you do not trust,
the goal of this tool is to run PHP snippets to test the features and 
behaviour of PHP.
